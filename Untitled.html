Reference for Common HTML Elements

This page lists all the common HTML elements. They are grouped by function to help you find what you have in mind easily. This is a curated list from Mozilla Developer's Network for your use in this prep work.

Main sectioning elements

Element	Description
html	The HTML html element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element.
head	The HTML head element contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets.
body	The HTML body Element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one body element in a document.
Document metadata

Element	Description
link	The HTML External Resource Link element (link) specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to stylesheets, but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things.
title	The HTML Title element (title) defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab.
Content sections

Element	Description
footer	The HTML footer element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.
header	The HTML header element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.
h1, h2, etc.	The HTML h1–h6 elements represent six levels of section headings. h1 is the highest section level and h6 is the lowest.
main	The HTML main element represents the dominant content of the body of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.
nav	The HTML nav element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.
section	The HTML section element represents a standalone section — which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it — contained within an HTML document.
Text content

Element	Description
div	The HTML Content Division element (div) is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS.
li	The HTML li element is used to represent an item in a list.
ol	The HTML ol element represents an ordered list of items — typically rendered as a numbered list.
p	The HTML p element represents a paragraph.
ul	The HTML ul element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.
Inline text semantics

Element	Description
a	The HTML a element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.
br	The HTML br element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.
em	The HTML em element marks text that has stress emphasis. The em element can be nested, with each level of nesting indicating a greater degree of emphasis.
span	The HTML span element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang.
strong	The HTML Strong Importance Element (strong) indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.
Image and multimedia

Element	Description
img	The HTML img element embeds an image into the document.
Table content

Element	Description
table	The HTML table element represents tabular data — that is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.
tbody	The HTML Table Body element (tbody) encapsulates a set of table rows (tr elements), indicating that they comprise the body of the table (table).
td	The HTML td element defines a cell of a table that contains data. It participates in the table model.
tfoot	The HTML tfoot element defines a set of rows summarizing the columns of the table.
th	The HTML th element defines a cell as header of a group of table cells. The exact nature of this group is defined by the scope and headers attributes.
thead	The HTML thead element defines a set of rows defining the head of the columns of the table.
tr	The HTML tr element defines a row of cells in a table. The row's cells can then be established using a mix of td (data cell) and th (header cell) elements.
Forms

Element	Description
button	The HTML button element represents a clickable button, which can be used in forms or anywhere in a document that needs simple, standard button functionality.
fieldset	The HTML fieldset element is used to group several controls as well as labels (label) within a web form.
form	The HTML form element represents a document section that contains interactive controls for submitting information to a web server.
input	The HTML input element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent.
label	The HTML label element represents a caption for an item in a user interface.
legend	The HTML legend element represents a caption for the content of its parent fieldset.
option	The HTML option element is used to define an item contained in a select, an optgroup, or a datalist element. As such, option can represent menu items in popups and other lists of items in an HTML document.
select	The HTML select element represents a control that provides a menu of options
textarea	The HTML textarea element represents a multi-line plain-text editing control, useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizable amount of free-form text, for example a comment on a review or feedback form.
